IMERFD(2)		      System Calls Manual		    TIMERFD(2)

NAME
       timerfd,	 timerfd_create,  timerfd_gettime,  timerfd_settime  --	timers
       with file descriptor semantics

LIBRARY
       Standard	C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include	<sys/timerfd.h>

       int
       timerfd_create(int clockid, int flags);

       int
       timerfd_gettime(int fd, struct itimerspec *curr_value);

       int
       timerfd_settime(int fd, int flags,  const struct	itimerspec *new_value,
	   struct itimerspec *old_value);

DESCRIPTION
       The  timerfd  system  calls  operate  on	 timers, identified by special
       timerfd file descriptors.  These	calls are analogous to timer_create(),
       timer_gettime(),	and timer_settime() per-process	timer  functions,  but
       use a timerfd descriptor	in place of timerid.

       All  timerfd descriptors	possess	traditional file descriptor semantics;
       they may	be passed to other processes, preserved	 across	 fork(2),  and
       monitored  via  kevent(2),  poll(2),  or	select(2).  When a timerfd de-
       scriptor	is no longer needed, it	may be disposed	of using close(2).

       timerfd_create()	   Initialize a	timerfd	object and return its file de-
			   scriptor.  The clockid argument specifies the clock
			   used	as a timing base and may be:

			   CLOCK_REALTIME      Increments  as  a  wall	 clock
					       should.
			   CLOCK_MONOTONIC     Increments  monotonically in SI
					       seconds.

			   The flags argument may contain the result of	or'ing
			   the following values:

			   TFD_CLOEXEC	    The	newly generated	file  descrip-
					    tor	will close-on-exec.
			   TFD_NONBLOCK	    Do	not block on read/write	opera-
					    tions.

       timerfd_gettime()   Retrieve the	current	state of the timer denoted  by
			   fd.	The result is stored in	curr_value as a	struct
			   itimerspec.	 The  it_value and it_interval members
			   of curr_value represent the relative	time until the
			   next	expiration and the interval reload value  last
			   set by timerfd_settime(), respectively.

       timerfd_settime()   Update  the	timer  denoted	by  fd with the	struct
			   itimerspec in new_value.  The  it_value  member  of
			   new_value  should contain the amount	of time	before
			   the timer expires, or zero if the timer  should  be
			   disarmed.   The  it_interval	 member	should contain
			   the reload time if an interval timer	is desired.

			   The	previous  timer	 state	will  be   stored   in
			   old_value given old_value is	not NULL.

			   The flags argument may contain the result of	or'ing
			   the following values:

			   TFD_TIMER_ABSTIME	    Expiration	will  occur at
						    the	absolute time provided
						    in	new_value.   Normally,
						    new_value	represents   a
						    relative time compared  to
						    the	timer's	clockid	clock.
			   TFD_TIMER_CANCEL_ON_SET  If clockid has been	set to
						    CLOCK_REALTIME and the re-
						    altime  clock  has experi-
						    enced   a	 discontinuous
						    jump,  then	the timer will
						    be canceled	and  the  next
						    read(2)   will  fail  with
						    ECANCELED.

       File operations have the	following semantics:

       read(2)
	      Transfer the number of  timer  expirations  that	have  occurred
	      since  the last successful read(2) or timerfd_settime() into the
	      output buffer of size uint64_t.  If the  expiration  counter  is
	      zero,  read(2)  blocks  until  a	timer expiration occurs	unless
	      TFD_NONBLOCK is set, where EAGAIN	is returned.

       poll(2)
	      The file	descriptor  is	readable  when	its  timer  expiration
	      counter is greater than zero.

       ioctl(2)

	      FIOASYNC int
			A non-zero input will set the FASYNC flag.  A zero in-
			put will clear the FASYNC flag.

	      FIONBIO int
			A  non-zero input will set the FNONBLOCK flag.	A zero
			input will clear the FNONBLOCK flag.

RETURN VALUES
       The timerfd_create() system call	creates	a timerfd object  and  returns
       its file	descriptor.  If	an error occurs, -1 is returned	and the	global
       variable	errno is set to	indicate the error.

       The  timerfd_gettime()  and  timerfd_settime() system calls return 0 on
       success.	 If an error occurs, -1	is returned and	 the  global  variable
       errno is	set to indicate	the error.

ERRORS
       The timerfd_create() system call	fails if:

       [EINVAL]		  The specified	clockid	is not supported.

       [EINVAL]		  The provided flags are invalid.

       [EMFILE]		  The per-process descriptor table is full.

       [ENFILE]		  The system file table	is full.

       [ENOMEM]		  The  kernel failed to	allocate enough	memory for the
			  timer.

       Both timerfd_gettime() and timerfd_settime() system calls fail if:

       [EBADF]		  The provided fd is invalid.

       [EFAULT]		  The addresses	provided by curr_value,	new_value,  or
			  old_value are	invalid.

       [EINVAL]		  The  provided	 fd is valid, but was not generated by
			  timerfd_create().

       The following errors only apply to timerfd_settime():

       [EINVAL]		  The provided flags are invalid.

       [EINVAL]		  A nanosecond field in	the new_value argument	speci-
			  fied	a  value  less	than  zero, or greater than or
			  equal	to 10^9.

       [ECANCELED]	  The  timer   was   created   with   the   clock   ID
			  CLOCK_REALTIME,     was    configured	   with	   the
			  TFD_TIMER_CANCEL_ON_SET flag,	and the	 system	 real-
			  time	clock experienced a discontinuous change with-
			  out being read.

       A read from a timerfd object fails if:

       [EAGAIN]		  The timer's  expiration  counter  is	zero  and  the
			  timerfd object is set	for non-blocking I/O.

       [ECANCELED]	  The	timer	was   created	with   the   clock  ID
			  CLOCK_REALTIME,    was    configured	  with	   the
			  TFD_TIMER_CANCEL_ON_SET  flag,  and the system real-
			  time clock experienced a discontinuous change.

       [EINVAL]		  The size of the read buffer is not large  enough  to
			  hold the uint64_t sized timer	expiration counter.

STANDARDS
       The timerfd system calls	originated from	Linux and are non-standard.

HISTORY
       The timerfd facility was	originally ported to FreeBSD's Linux  compati-
       bility  layer  by  Dmitry Chagin	<dchagin@FreeBSD.org> in FreeBSD 12.0.
       It  was	revised	 and  adapted  to   be	 native	  by   Jake   Freeland
       <jfree@FreeBSD.org> in FreeBSD 14.0.
